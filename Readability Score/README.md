# About

## We all love different kinds of books. As we grow up, we are able to digest more difficult texts easier. 
## How to assess the difficulty of a given text? How can you make your program do that? 
## Write a program that determines the difficulty of a text and predicts the grade level needed to understand this text.


# Learning outcomes

## Learn to call programs from the command line and gain experience with regexes and math library.


# This project is a part of the following tracks:

## [Python Developer](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)
## [Natural Language Processing](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/10)

##### Note : The project could be also completed with the help of ReadabilityCalculator module in just a few lines of code, 
#####        but for learning purposes I preferred the 'hard' way !.
