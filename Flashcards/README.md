# About


When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, 
which is exactly where flashcards can help. 
Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. 
Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data, so if you want to create a useful tool to 
help your learning and your programming skills, this project is for you.
