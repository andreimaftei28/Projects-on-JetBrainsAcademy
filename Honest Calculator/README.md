# About

### The International Union Against Idleness (IUAI) announced a competition for an application that would motivate users. There are prizes involved. 
### Since you like competing and know a little bit about programming, you asked your friend to prepare an interesting algorithm for a quick buck. 
### Unfortunately, you weren't clear enough, and instead of a ready-made program, a friend prepared a flowchart of Honest Calculator. 
### You will have to put some effort into assembling it.


# Learning outcomes

### Learn how to read flowcharts to hone your understanding of loops, conditions, and algorithms. 
### It will allow you to write your own algorithms. This skill also prevents multiple changes from occurring during production.

## This project is a part of the following tracks:
### * [Python Core](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2) 
### * [Python for Beginners](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/6) 
### * [Natural Language Processing](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/10)
