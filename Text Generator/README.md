# About

Machine learning is getting crazy smart these days. 
You've probably read texts or scripts written by machine learning algorithms, some of them even mimicking styles of certain people! 
If you ever wondered how it works and what are the secrets behind machine learning, this project is for you! 
You will have a chance to understand and implement a simple text generator using Markov chains.


# Learning outcomes

You will create a program that can predict the next word in a pseudo-sentence based on the 
previous words in the sequence and the data that is used to create a statistical model. 
You will get a deeper understanding of natural language processing, 
string operations, and the application of statistics in your code.
