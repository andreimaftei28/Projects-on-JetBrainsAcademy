# About

### Your great-grandmother asked you to copy "to these computers" all the recipes that she had been collecting in her notebook for several decades. 
### You don't like the easy ways, so you decide to build a recipe database. You will need to refresh your SQL knowledge to build a simple backend.


# Learning outcomes

### You will create a simple backend that will allow you to populate an SQLite3 database. 
### You will know how to deal with the primary key auto-increment and how to use foreign keys to create 
### relationships between the tables. Learn how to deal with many-to-many relations. Work with SQL queries and database cursor methods.
