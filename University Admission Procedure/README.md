# About


## It takes a lot of hard work to enroll in the university of your dreams. 
## Although, we tend to dismiss how difficult it is for the university to handle the document volume. 
## In this project, you'll deal with university applicants. You'll implement an algorithm to determine which applicants are going to be enrolled. 
## At each stage, the algorithm will gradually become more complex and comprehensive!



# Learning outcomes

## Practice loops and various mathematical operations. 
## Learn how to handle files and different types of collections such as lists (including nested lists) and dictionaries. 
## Put to use the sorting function and see how useful it can be.



# This project is a part of the following track
